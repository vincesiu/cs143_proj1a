Julien Brundrett

We used git as a version control system to enable easy collaboration. Julien implemented the basic HTML framework including the input form, as well as catching form input in PHP code. Vincent took the form input and performed the required error checking before passing to the evaluate function. Testing was performed collaboratively to find and resolve errors.
